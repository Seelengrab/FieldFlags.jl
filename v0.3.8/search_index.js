The struct can optionally be marked mutable.\n\nSee also @bitflags.\n\nExtended Help\n\nThe fields are stored in a compact format where each field only takes up the specified number of bits. Field access gives an unsigned integer, whose lower bits are the bits of the accessed field. The upper bits are zeroed. As a special case, fields with size 1 return a Bool. Explicit padding can be specified by naming a field _, with freely chosen width. Field names (other than padding) need to be unique. The specified number of bits must be >= 0.\n\nThe order the fields are given in is the order the fields are stored in. The first field occupies the least significant bits, followed by the second field, up to the last field, which is stored in the most significant bits.\n\nFor example, the struct given above has this layout:\n\nMSB        LSB\nc _ _ _ b b b a a\n\nwhere _ is padding, with undefined value.\n\nThe constructor created for structs defined with @bitfield takes any type in Union{Int128, Int16, Int32, Int64, Int8, UInt128, UInt16, UInt32, UInt64, UInt8, Bool} and converts it to the correct size by truncating the upper bits, before storing the truncated value in the object. This truncation also occurs when writing to a field of a mutable object.\n\nwarning: Struct size\nDue to compiler limitations, the size of the resulting object will (currently) always be a multiple of 8 bits. The additional bits added due to this are considered padding and can not be relied on to exist. They may be removed in a future release without notice. If you need padding up to a given size, explicitly specify a trailing padding field.\n\nwarning: Field type\nAs there are no variable sized integers in Julia, it is only guaranteed that the return type on field access is large enough to hold all bits required by that field. While currently field sizes larger than 1 return an UInt, this is in particular not guaranteed and may be changed in the future, so that e.g. a field of size 2 returns an UInt8 instead.\n\nExamples\n\njulia> @bitfield struct MyBits\n           a:2\n           b:3\n           _:3 # padding\n           c:1\n       end\n\njulia> bits = MyBits(1,2,3)\nMyBits(a: 0x1, b: 0x2, c: true)\n\njulia> bits.a\n0x0000000000000001\n\njulia> bits.b\n0x0000000000000002\n\njulia> bits.c\ntrue\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"macro"},{"location":"api/#Functions","page":"API Reference","title":"Functions","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"api/","page":"API Reference","title":"API Reference","text":"These functions are explicitly not exported, to prevent confusion with Base.fieldoffset and similar field and property related functions.","category":"page"},{"location":"api/","page":"API Reference","title":"API Reference","text":"FieldFlags.propertyoffset\nFieldFlags.fieldsize","category":"page"},{"location":"api/#FieldFlags.propertyoffset","page":"API Reference","title":"FieldFlags.propertyoffset","text":"propertyoffset(::Type{T}, s::Symbol) -> Int\n\nGives the offset (in bits) the field s is placed at in objects of type T.\n\nSee also FieldFlags.fieldsize.\n\njulia> @bitflags mutable struct MyFlags\n           flagA\n           _ # padding\n           flagB\n       end\n\njulia> FieldFlags.propertyoffset(MyFlags, :flagA)\n0\n\njulia> FieldFlags.propertyoffset(MyFlags, :flagB)\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"function"},{"location":"api/#FieldFlags.fieldsize","page":"API Reference","title":"FieldFlags.fieldsize","text":"fieldsize(::Type{T}, s::Symbol) -> Int\n\nGives the size (in bits) the field s takes up in objects of type T.\n\nSee also FieldFlags.propertyoffset.\n\njulia> @bitfield mutable struct MyBits\n           a:2\n           _ # padding\n           b:3\n       end\n\njulia> FieldFlags.fieldsize(MyBits, :a)\n2\n\njulia> FieldFlags.fieldsize(MyBits, :b)\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"function"},{"location":"api/#Additional-Supported-API","page":"API Reference","title":"Additional Supported API","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"api/","page":"API Reference","title":"API Reference","text":"These functions are listed because they are supported, but their docstrings can't be displayed without having an instance of a type created via @bitfield or @bitflags.","category":"page"},{"location":"api/","page":"API Reference","title":"API Reference","text":"Base.propertynames\nGives a tuple of the properties given in the original expression given to @bitfield or @bitflags.\nconvert(::T, x::Union{Bool, Base.BitInteger})\nConverts x to a T, originally created via the macros of this package.
